# COMPUTER-ORGANIZATION-FINAL-PROJECT
If I summarize the Final Project, By researching the hardware acceleration, I expressed the relationship between the final project and the descriptive codes via c ++. The names of the codes I use in my homework are briefly as follows; Unoptimized Code, AVX Code, AVX + Unroll Code, AVX + Unroll + blocked Code and OpenGL codes have been run through certain stages in Visual Studio 2019.And the measurement results are noted and added to the presentation file. I obtained individually the codes by searching from the book titled Computer Organization Design 5th Edition 2014 as stated in the final assignment (Com Org Project 2020 Spring.docx). By doing research on the content of the given final assignment, I answered the questions about how it was done and what was the result and I analyzed the results of each step. I used charts to better understand the results.
